# Contributing to Script Seed

Thank you for contributing to Script Seed! Here are some notes to help you out.

If you haven't finished the [README](README.md), start there to understand how
this project uses Docker. You don't need to have Docker installed to work with a
single script, but you do need it to run the tests or work with all our scripts
without installing all the dependencies. If you can't run the tests locally,
[TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/github/mkasberg/script-seed) will run them for
you when you make a PR. Pay attention to the results.

## Test Suite

The test suite requires [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (because of our
dependency on a lot of different languages). Use `make` to run the tests:

    $ make test

Inside the container, we run the `test.sh` script (which an also be run outside
the container if you have all the dependencies installed). `test.sh` makes some
simple assertions on all of our scripts:

 * The script executes without throwing errors.
 * The script produces a useful help message with the `-h` flag.
 * The script is an executable text file (with a shebang).

## GitHub Pages Website

The GitHub Pages site is a relatively basic page with HTML and Javascript. Use
`make` to run the website locally:

    $ make server

It's important to note that we have some Javascript code that makes async
requests for the script resources themselves. Serving async requests over the
`file://` protocol will not work in a browser, so we use a
[local test server](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server)
to develop the website locally inside Docker.

## How to Add a Language

I want this repository to have a "script seed" (an basic example script) for every language than can run on Linux with a `#!` line!

If you want to add a language:

 1. Add the script itself to `seeds/`. Don't forget to make it executable (`chmod +x`).
 2. Add any required dependencies to the `Dockerfile`. Install using `apt-get` if possible (the Dockerfile is for Ubuntu Linux). Otherwise, install using any method that works.

 3. Add the script to the list in `index.html` so it appears in our dropdown.

 4. Add the script to the list in `main.js` so we get syntax highlighting.

## Tips for Contributing

* If you're making improvements to an existing script, try to keep your commits
  concise, and explain the reason for the change in a [well
  written](https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)
  commit message.
* If you're adding a new language, make sure your script is executable and
  includes a proper shebang line at the top. Prefer `#!/usr/bin/env` where
  appropriate.
* To pass our simple test harness, your script should print usage instructions
  when `-h` is passed.
* Have fun with the message, but make sure it includes the string
  `You planted a` when run with no args.
* For simplicity and testing reasons, we only support languages that can be run as an executable text file (with a `#!`) on Ubuntu Linux.
* If you need help with the `Dockerfile` or HTML or JS, just open a PR with the script itself and we'll try to help you through the rest.
* Your pull request will be automatically tested by
  [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/mkasberg/script-seed).
